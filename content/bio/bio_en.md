## Research Focus

Our study employs scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to investigate the atomic-scale structural characteristics of ferroelectric materials and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing their mechanical and electrical properties. Particular emphasis is placed on the heterojunction interfaces between ferroelectric thin films and their respective substrates, where we systematically examine the correlation between atomic-level structural configurations in the presence of strain and crystalline defects, and the resulting spontaneous polarization and electric field distributions.
